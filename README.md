# Vala Workspace Prep Script

Is a simple script to install the latest Vala compiler and language server for VsCode/Gnome Builder on an Ubuntu 18.04 based rootfs.  For x86_64 it's recommended to 
[use the ppa](https://github.com/benwaffle/vala-language-server#installation). This is intended more for other architecture like aarch64.
